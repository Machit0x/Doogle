# Doogle. Everything about dogs.

## About the project

This project was made entirely by one person (me :D). it´s a SPA based on React in wich you can learn about dogs.
I´ve implemented functionalities such as filtering by temperaments and origin (database dogs or api dogs), sorting by alphabet, weight or life span, searching by full breed or part of it, pagination showing 8 breeds for page and the posibility to create your own dog by a controlled form with javascript.
